# Transparent Public Infrastructure Maintenance System

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes public infrastructure management by creating a transparent, immutable record of assets, inspections, maintenance, and performance. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the system ensures accountability in infrastructure spending, optimal maintenance scheduling, and data-driven decision making for public works departments. This platform connects government agencies, contractors, auditors, and citizens in a transparent ecosystem that enhances public trust while improving infrastructure reliability.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Asset Registration Contract**
    - Records details of public infrastructure assets
    - Maintains a comprehensive digital inventory of bridges, roads, water systems, etc.
    - Stores essential data including location, construction date, materials, and design specifications
    - Tracks asset ownership and jurisdictional responsibilities
    - Manages asset lifecycle stages from commissioning to decommissioning
    - Provides public transparency into infrastructure investments

2. **Inspection Scheduling Contract**
    - Manages regular condition assessments
    - Implements risk-based inspection scheduling algorithms
    - Coordinates inspector assignments and certifications
    - Tracks inspection history and compliance with regulatory requirements
    - Stores inspection reports with photo/video evidence
    - Generates automated alerts for inspection deadlines

3. **Maintenance Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors repair activities and costs
    - Records maintenance work orders, approvals, and completions
    - Tracks expenditures against budgets with line-item transparency
    - Manages contractor qualifications and performance
    - Documents materials used and warranty information
    - Creates immutable audit trails for all maintenance activities

4. **Performance Measurement Contract**
    - Evaluates infrastructure reliability and service levels
    - Implements standardized performance metrics
    - Tracks asset uptime, service disruptions, and user complaints
    - Calculates lifecycle cost and maintenance efficiency
    - Benchmarks performance across similar assets
    - Provides data for capital planning and replacement decisions

## Key Benefits

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on:
- Ethereum blockchain for core smart contract functionality
- IPFS for decentralized storage of inspection reports and documentation
- IoT integration for real-time condition monitoring data
- Mobile applications for field inspections and maintenance
- GIS integration for spatial visualization and analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or compatible Ethereum wallet

```

### Configuration

1. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
2. Configure asset categories and inspection requirements
3. Set up jurisdiction-specific maintenance standards
4. Define performance metrics for different asset classes

## Usage Examples

### Registering an Infrastructure Asset

```javascript
const AssetRegistry = artifacts.require("AssetRegistry");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const registry = await AssetRegistry.deployed();
  
  await registry.registerAsset(
    "Memorial Bridge",
    "Bridge",
    "42.3601° N, 71.0589° W", // Geographic coordinates
    1986, // Construction year
    "Steel truss bridge with concrete deck, 250m span",
    "City of Riverside",
    100000000, // Construction cost in cents (1M USD)
    50, // Expected lifespan in years
    "ipfs://QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ" // IPFS hash for asset documentation
  );
  
  console.log("Asset registered successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Scheduling an Inspection

```javascript
const InspectionScheduling = artifacts.require("InspectionScheduling");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const inspection = await InspectionScheduling.deployed();
  
  const assetId = 1; // ID from asset registration
  const scheduledDate = Math.floor(new Date(2025, 5, 15).getTime() / 1000); // June 15, 2025
  
  await inspection.scheduleInspection(
    assetId,
    "Annual Structural Inspection",
    scheduledDate,
    "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", // Inspector address
    "Professional Engineer, Bridge Inspection Certification", // Inspector qualifications
    "AASHTO NBIS Standards" // Inspection standards to apply
  );
  
  console.log("Inspection scheduled successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Recording Maintenance Activity

```javascript
const MaintenanceTracking = artifacts.require("MaintenanceTracking");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const maintenance = await MaintenanceTracking.deployed();
  
  const assetId = 1; // ID from asset registration
  const completionDate = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
  
  await maintenance.recordMaintenance(
    assetId,
    "Deck Joint Replacement",
    "Replacement of 8 expansion joints on main span",
    completionDate,
    "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12", // Contractor address

  const assetId = 1; // ID from asset registration
  const recordDate = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
  
  await performance.recordPerformanceMetrics(
    assetId,
    recordDate,
    [
      "traffic_volume:15000", // Average daily traffic
      "condition_index:78", // Overall condition score
      "service_disruptions:2", // Number of closures in period
      "response_time:48", // Hours to address critical issues
      "user_complaints:12" // Number of reported issues
    ],
    "Q2-2025", // Reporting period
    "ipfs://QmUNLLsPACCz1vLxQVkXqqLX5R1X345qqfHbsf67hvA3Nn" // IPFS hash for detailed report
