# Secure Healthcare Provider Credentialing System

A blockchain-based solution for managing healthcare provider credentials, qualifications, hospital privileges, and insurance network participation.

## Overview

The Secure Healthcare Provider Credentialing System leverages blockchain technology to create a trusted, immutable record of healthcare practitioner credentials. This system reduces administrative overhead, prevents fraud, and streamlines the credentialing process across healthcare organizations.

## System Components

### Provider Identity Contract

This smart contract serves as the foundation of the system, creating a unique digital identity for each healthcare provider.

**Key Features:**
- Secure digital identity creation and verification
- Management of basic provider information (name, NPI, specialties)
- Connection to other credential contracts via provider ID
- Multi-factor authentication for identity verification
- Audit trail of all identity modifications

### Qualification Verification Contract

This contract validates and stores provider qualifications, including medical degrees, certifications, and training.

**Key Features:**
- Tamper-proof storage of qualification documents
- Direct verification with issuing institutions
- Automatic expiration tracking and renewal notifications
- Verification status visible to authorized parties
- Historical record of all qualifications

### Hospital Privileging Contract

This contract manages the specific procedures and services that providers are authorized to perform at each healthcare facility.

**Key Features:**
- Institution-specific privileges management
- Procedure-level granularity for authorization
- Temporary and emergency privileging capabilities
- Automated renewal and review processes
- Cross-institutional privilege verification

### Insurance Panel Contract

This contract tracks provider participation in various insurance networks and payment programs.

**Key Features:**
- Insurance network enrollment status
- Contract terms and billing rates
- Network-specific identifier management
- Participation history and changes
- Real-time verification for claims processing

## Technical Architecture

The system uses a permissioned blockchain architecture with the following characteristics:

- Smart contracts written in Solidity for Ethereum-based implementation
- Role-based access control for different stakeholder types
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Interoperability with existing healthcare IT systems
- API integration capabilities for third-party applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or similar Ethereum wallet
- Access to an Ethereum testnet or private network

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/healthcare-credentialing.git

# Install dependencies
cd healthcare-credentialing
npm install

# Deploy contracts to your network
truffle migrate --network [network_name]
```

## Usage Examples

### Provider Registration

```javascript
// Register a new provider
await ProviderIdentityContract.registerProvider(
  "Dr. Jane Smith", 
  "1234567890", // NPI
  ["Cardiology", "Internal Medicine"], // Specialties
  providerAddress,
  additionalData
);
```

### Verifying Qualifications

```javascript
// Add a new qualification
await QualificationContract.addQualification(
  providerId,
  "Medical Degree",
  "Harvard Medical School",
  "2010-05-15", // Issue date
  "2040-05-15", // Expiration date
  "ipfs://QmXyz..." // Document hash
);

// Verify a qualification
const isValid = await QualificationContract.verifyQualification(qualificationId);
```

### Managing Hospital Privileges

```javascript
// Grant procedure privileges
await HospitalPrivilegingContract.grantProcedurePrivilege(
  providerId,
  hospitalId,
  "Coronary Angioplasty",
  "2023-01-01", // Start date
  "2025-01-01", // End date
  approverProviderId
);
```

### Insurance Network Enrollment

```javascript
// Enroll provider in insurance network
await InsurancePanelContract.enrollProvider(
  providerId,
  insuranceNetworkId,
  "PCN1234567", // Provider contract number
  ["Service A", "Service B"], // Approved services
  "2023-01-01", // Effective date
  contractDocumentHash
);
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is stored off-chain with only hashes stored on the blockchain
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations
- Disaster recovery procedures
